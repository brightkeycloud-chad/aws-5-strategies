## Disabling Unused AWS Regions in Your AWS Account

Disabling unused AWS regions can prevent unauthorized resource deployment and potential data breaches in those regions. Follow these steps to disable unused regions through the AWS Management Console.

### Step 1: Sign in to AWS Management Console
- **Access the Console**: Open your web browser and navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
- **Log in** with your AWS account credentials.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Account Settings
- Once logged in, click on your account name or number at the top-right corner of the console.
- Select **My Account** from the dropdown menu.

### Step 3: Scroll to AWS Regions
- In the **My Account** page, scroll down to the **AWS Regions** section.
- Here, you will see a list of all AWS regions and their status (Enabled or Disabled).

### Step 4: Disable Unused Regions
- Click on the **Edit** button in the AWS Regions section.
- You will be presented with a list of regions. Each region will have a toggle switch indicating if it is enabled or disabled.
- For each region that you wish to disable, change the toggle from Enabled to Disabled.
- **Note**: Be cautious when disabling regions where you might have active resources. Ensure that there are no resources or services running in a region before disabling it.

### Step 5: Confirm Changes
- After toggling off the unused regions, click **Save changes**.
- You may be prompted to enter your account password again for security purposes to confirm the changes.

Remember, you can always re-enable a region if your business needs change or if you decide to deploy resources in that region at a later date.
