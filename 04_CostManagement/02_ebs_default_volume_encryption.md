## Configuring Regional Default EBS Volume Encryption in AWS

Enabling default EBS volume encryption ensures that all new EBS volumes and snapshot copies created in the specified region are encrypted, helping protect your data at rest. Follow these steps to enable default EBS encryption in your AWS account for a specific region.

### Step 1: Sign in to AWS Management Console
- **Access the Console**: Open your web browser and navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
- **Log in** with your AWS account credentials.

### Step 2: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard
- From the AWS Management Console, open the **Services** menu.
- Select **EC2** under the Compute section to go to the EC2 Dashboard.

### Step 3: Open the EBS Section
- In the EC2 dashboard, locate the **Elastic Block Store** section in the navigation pane on the left.
- Click on **Volumes** to access the volumes page.

### Step 4: Manage EBS Encryption
- While in the **Volumes** section, click on **Settings** in the navigation pane.
- Select **Manage EBS encryption** from the dropdown menu.

### Step 5: Configure EBS Encryption Settings
- You will be redirected to the **EBS encryption** page.
- Here, you can see the current encryption settings for the region you are logged into.

### Step 6: Edit the Settings
- Click on **Edit** to change the encryption settings.
- You will see options for:
  - **Encryption by default**: Toggle this to **Enabled** to ensure that all new EBS volumes created in the region are encrypted by default.
  - **KMS key**: Select the default AWS managed key (`aws/ebs`) or choose a custom AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that you have previously created.

### Step 7: Save the Configuration
- After adjusting the settings, click **Save** to apply the changes.
- A confirmation dialog will appear. Confirm the settings to proceed.

### Step 8: Verification and Testing
- To verify, create a new EBS volume in the region.
- Check the details of the new volume to ensure that it is encrypted by default using the specified KMS key.

Remember, this setting is regional and must be enabled individually in each region where you want default encryption for EBS volumes.
